# AR-RayCast
Augmented Reality based on Ray Cast Technology and using Unity, C#.

Using augmented reality and ray cast technologies provided by unity and C#, an android application of version >=7.0 was built,
ground plane must first be detected by the application,
with each touch a random object would appear that has its own, sound effects and animation,
upon touching again a new object appears,
no object appears twice in a row,
you can place the object where you want by dragging your touch, so instead of touch.end I used touch.moved in my script.
All object are 3D objects.
