# AR-RayCast
Augmented Reality Project based on Ray Cast Technology using XR Package of Unity and C#

Using augmented reality and ray cast technologies provided by unity and C#, an android application of android version >=7.0 is built.

Ground plane must first be detected by the application.

With each touch a random 3D object would appear that has its own sound effect and animation.

Upon touching again a new object appears.

No object appears twice in a row.

You can place the object where you want by dragging your touch, so instead of "touch.end" , I used "touch.moved" in my script.

This is a 3D Project.
